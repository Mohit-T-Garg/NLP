Pseudorabies virus tegument protein UL13 inhibits STING-mediated antiviral signaling via regulation of STING stability. Mechanistically, UL13 interacts with the CDN domain of STING and recruits the E3 ligase RING-finger protein 5 ( RNF5 ) to promote K27-/K29-linked ubiquitination and degradation of STING. Consequently, deficiency of RNF5 enhances host antiviral immune responses triggered by PRV infection. In addition, mutant PRV lacking UL13 impaired in antagonism of STING-mediated production of type I IFNs and shows attenuated pathogenicity in mice.

shugoshin interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres in budding yeast. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast. Using peptide prints, we identified a Serine-Rich Motif ( SRM ) of Sgo1 that mediates the interaction with condensin and is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. We show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the phosphomimic and phosphoresistant mutants revealed that SRM phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin–condensin interaction. We present evidence that Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast.

Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) causes lymphomas and epithelial cell cancers. We have previously found that EBV, through activation of cellular STAT3, prevents phosphorylation of Chk1, and thereby, suppresses activation of the intra-S phase cell-cycle checkpoint, a potent barrier to oncogene-driven proliferation. This observation prompted us to examine the consequences on DNA repair since EBV, through activation of cellular STAT3, requires phosphorylation of Chk1, and thereby, homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks. The resulting reliance on error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining ( MMEJ ) repair makes EBV-transformed cells susceptible to PARP inhibition and simultaneous accrual of genome-wide deletions and insertions resulting from synthesis-dependent MMEJ.

Collective living systems regularly achieve cooperative emergent functions that individual organisms could not accomplish alone . The rafts of fire ants ( Solenopsis invicta ) are often studied in this context for their ability to create aggregated structures comprised entirely of their own bodies , including tether-like protrusions that facilitate exploration of and escape from flooded environments . While similar protrusions are observed in cytoskeletons and cellular aggregates , they are generally dependent on morphogens or external gradients leaving the isolated role of local interactions poorly understood . Ultimately , we demonstrate how phases of exploratory protrusion growth may be induced by increased ant activity as characterized by a dimensionless parameter , A . These results provide an example in which functional morphogenesis of a living system may emerge purely from local interactions at the constituent length scale , thereby providing a source of inspiration for the development of decentralized , autonomous active matter and swarm robotics .

Temporal environmental variations affect diversity in communities of competing populations . In particular , the covariance between competition and environment is known to facilitate invasions of rare species via the storage effect . Here we present a quantitative study of the effects of temporal variations in two-species and in diverse communities . When this number is large , the same trends hold: storage effect and periodic variations increase both species richness and the evenness of the community . Surprisingly , when the number of temporal niches is small global competition acts to decrease species richness and evenness , as it focuses the competition to specific periods , thus increasing the effective fitness differences.

One of the unique traits of membrane proteins is that a significant fraction of their hydrophobic amino acids is exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior , which is often not explicitly considered in the protein structure and function predictions . Here , we propose a characteristic and predictive quantity , the membrane contact probability ( MCP ) , to describe the likelihood of the amino acids of a given sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules . We show that MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins , and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD , a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with a known structure . We show that MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins , and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD , a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with a known structure . As the first of many potential applications , we demonstrate that MCP can be used to systematically improve the prediction precision of the protein contact maps and structures . Hence,  With the predicted contact maps and the predicted three-state secondary structures [75] , we can build protein structure models of a query sequence using CONFOLD2 [52] . With the scripts in the CONFOLD2 package , we converted the predicted secondary structures to distance , dihedral , and hydrogen bond restraints . We used the top-xL contacts as contact distance restraints , where x = 0 . 0 ps . The all-atom MD simulation was performed with the Amber99sb-ildn force field [87] in combination with the Slipids force field [88 , 89] .

Real-world agents , humans as well as animals , observe each other during interactions and choose their own actions taking the partners’ ongoing behaviour into account . Yet , classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously without knowing each other’s current choices . To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints , we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games , where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner’s choice before deciding on its own action . In both games , “Win–stay , lose–shift” and “Tit-for-tat” strategies are predominant for moderate transparency , while a “Leader-Follower” strategy emerges for high transparency . Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour , especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions . Hence,  In this study , we focus on iterated two-player ( dyadic ) two-action games: in every round both players choose one of two possible actions and get a payoff depending on the mutual choice according to the payoff matrix.

, lethal and lethal Lassa fever infections in Nigeria. We identify five recent isolates from the 2018 outbreak in Nigeria. Three isolates were further evaluated in vivo and despite being closely related and from the same spatial / geographic region of Nigeria, only one of the three isolates proved lethal in strain 13 guinea pigs and non-human primates ( NHP ). Additionally, this isolate exhibited atypical pathogenesis characteristics in the NHP model, most notably respiratory failure, not commonly described in hemorrhagic cases of LF.
This study aimed to evaluate the hematological and biochemical changes in S. mansoni infected patients compared to apparently healthy controls. The findings of this study showed significantly altered hematological and biochemical parameters among S. mansoni infected patients compared to apparently healthy controls. The finding of this study indicates the necessity of considering schistosomiasis as a cause of the abnormality or as a co-morbidity while interpreting hematological and biochemical profiles in schistosomiasis endemic areas.
